// Graph : network of nodes

// edge : connection b/w any two nodes
// vertices : nodes are called vertex in graph

// Types of Graph :

// BASED on edges //

// 1. uni-directional graph / directed graph
// edged point to one of the vertex  1->2

// 2. bi-directional graph / undirected graph
// edged point to both of the vertex  1<->2

// BASED on weight of edges //

// 1. weighted graph
// 2. un-weughted graph


// ------------------

// 1. un-directed un-weighted graph
// 2. un-direcred weighted graph
// 3. directed un-weighted graph
// 3. directed weighted graph
