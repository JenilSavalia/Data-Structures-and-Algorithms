// Heaps are Complete Binary trees

// 1. MAX Heap : 
// 2. MIN Heap : 



// Insertion Operation in MAX Heap

// Insert the element at last in the array and compare with its parents and swap elements till condidion of (MAX or MIN heap) is satisfied
// Time Complexicity for Insertion :  minimum : O(log n) , minimium : O(1)

// in Insertion adjustment is done (Uppward) from down to upward


// Delete Operation in MAX Heap


// in Deletion adjustment is done (Downward) from upward to downward
// When we delete a element from Max Heap, we get the largest element (that is root element is deleted) vice versa for MIN Heap

// Time Complexicity for Deletion :  minimum : O(log n) , minimium : O(1)
